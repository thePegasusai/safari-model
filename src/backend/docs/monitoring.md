    target_label: ml_accuracy
  - source_labels: [inference_time_seconds]
    target_label: ml_latency
```

#### ML Recording Rules
```yaml
groups:
  - name: ml_performance
    rules:
      - record: ml_model_accuracy_sla
        expr: avg_over_time(species_detection_accuracy[1h]) >= 0.90
      - record: ml_model_latency_sla
        expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(inference_time_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le)) <= 0.1
```

### Business Metrics

- Active users
- Species identifications per hour
- Collection growth rate
- User engagement metrics
- Data contribution statistics

## Alerting Configuration

### Critical Alerts

#### System Availability Alerts (Target: 99.9%)
```yaml
- alert: SystemAvailabilityBreach
  expr: avg_over_time(up[24h]) < 0.999
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: critical
    team: ops
  annotations:
    summary: "System availability below SLA"
    description: "System availability has dropped below 99.9% in the last 24 hours"
```

#### ML Performance Alerts
```yaml
- alert: MLAccuracyDrop
  expr: avg_over_time(species_detection_accuracy[1h]) < 0.90
  for: 15m
  labels:
    severity: critical
    team: ml
  annotations:
    summary: "ML model accuracy below threshold"
    description: "Species detection accuracy has dropped below 90% threshold"
```

### Alert Routing

#### ML Team Notifications
```yaml
routes:
  - receiver: 'ml-team'
    matchers:
      - 'team = ml'
    group_wait: 1m
    group_interval: 5m
    repeat_interval: 2h
```

## Disaster Recovery Monitoring

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO) Monitoring

| Component | RTO | Monitoring Approach |
|-----------|-----|-------------------|
| User Data | 1 hour | Automated failover checks |
| ML Models | 2 hours | Model deployment verification |
| Media Files | 4 hours | Storage replication monitoring |
| Config Data | 30 min | Configuration sync status |

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO) Monitoring

| Component | RPO | Monitoring Approach |
|-----------|-----|-------------------|
| User Data | 15 min | Replication lag monitoring |
| ML Models | 24 hours | Version control tracking |
| Media Files | 1 hour | Backup completion verification |
| Config Data | 5 min | Sync status monitoring |

### Health Check Configuration
```yaml
- job_name: 'health-checks'
  metrics_path: '/health'
  scrape_interval: 1m
  static_configs:
    - targets:
      - 'api-gateway:8080/health'
      - 'detection-service:8080/health'
      - 'collection-service:8080/health'
      - 'sync-service:8080/health'
```

## Dashboards

### Main System Dashboard

The main system dashboard provides a comprehensive view of system health and performance metrics:

- System availability gauge (Target: 99.9%)
- ML model accuracy gauge (Target: 90%)
- API response time graphs (Target: <100ms)
- ML inference time trends
- Resource utilization metrics
- Business KPI visualizations

Dashboard Configuration:
```json
{
  "title": "Wildlife Detection Safari System Dashboard",
  "uid": "wildlife-safari-main",
  "refresh": "10s",
  "tags": ["wildlife-safari", "monitoring"]
}
```

### ML Performance Dashboard

Dedicated dashboard for ML model monitoring:

- Species detection accuracy trends
- Model inference latency
- Confidence score distribution
