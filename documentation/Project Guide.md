# Project Guide

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Wildlife Detection Safari Pok√©dex is a sophisticated mobile application that combines advanced machine learning with gamification to enable real-time wildlife species identification and fossil recognition. The system leverages Liquid Neural Networks (LNN) for high-accuracy detection, supports offline operation, and integrates with global biodiversity databases. Key features include real-time species detection, 3D fossil scanning, personal collection management, and educational content delivery.
